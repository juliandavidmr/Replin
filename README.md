Replin, a dynamic tool built with SwiftUI that aims to streamline the translation process in TypeScript/JavaScript projects. As a work in progress, Replin addresses key aspects of localization by offering the following features:

### Automated JSON Extraction:
Replin efficiently traverses through all files within your TypeScript/JavaScript project to automatically extract JSON values related to translations. This automated process ensures a comprehensive collection of translation keys without manual intervention.

###  Live Translation Key Editing:
The standout feature of Replin is its ability to modify translation keys in real-time. With a sleek and intuitive SwiftUI interface, users can make on-the-fly adjustments to translation keys, facilitating a seamless editing experience.

### Ongoing Development:
Replin is actively being developed, with a commitment to enhancing its functionalities and incorporating user feedback. As a contributor or user, you can expect regular updates and improvements to make the localization process even more efficient and user-friendly.
